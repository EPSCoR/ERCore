# ERCore-3.1
ERcore content management system to assist with NSF EPSCoR reporting
This module aims to provide a generic platform for Universities to collect information about research and funding outcomes including: publications, proposals, collaborations, external engagements, etc. 
The module is being developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements of NSF's EPSCoR Grants.

This module is not intended for general purpose use, though you are welcome to try it out and adapt it to your own use.

Prior to downloading the ERcore module you will want to download and review the Administrator and Developer manuals.

The Developer manual will provide your IT specialists with the information they need to implement the Drupal software environment and create a new instance of the ERcore for your jurisdiction. The Administrator manual will provide your EPSCoR staff with instructions on how to set up and use the reporting system. On installation of the ERcore you will need to make choices about how the site will collect, handle and display your data. Working together, the manuals provide an easy, step-by-step process for spinning up a customized data management system for your NSF EPSCoR reporting.

You may also want to contact one of the EPSCoR jurisdictions already using the ERcore to answer your questions and provide guidance.
